# GEMINI Agent Instructions — Gamma Science

## Purpose
This repository contains scientific source references and grounding material for the Gamma Labyrinth.

## GAMMA-BUS Coordination Doctrine

Gamma Labyrinth uses a separated-but-synchronized coordination architecture:

1. ChatGPT/Hamm orchestration chat
   - Teacher/orchestrator cockpit.
   - Used for routing, synthesis, prompt generation, DELTA reconciliation, and final next-action decisions.
   - Not the durable execution ledger by itself.

2. GitHub issue in `gamma-labyrinth`
   - Standing GAMMA-BUS Coordination Thread.
   - Single durable cross-agent coordination thread / active agent ledger.
   - No secrets, no executable payloads, no unreceipted scientific truth.
   - Used for short cross-agent status, task links, blockers, handoffs, and final report links.

3. GitHub Project `gamma`
   - Control-plane board/status/task table.
   - Tracks issues, labels, status, routing, ownership, and evidence.
   - Not scientific Truth-plane state unless backed by receipts.

4. Separate task issues
   - Durable work envelopes for specific tasks.
   - Each task issue specifies repo, branch, plane, agent, scope, forbidden scope, evidence required, stop conditions, and final report format.

5. Separate worker chats
   - Agent-specific execution channels.
   - Windows Antigravity: front/UI/browser validation.
   - Gemini CLI: backend/runtime/git/terminal work.
   - Claude/Cowork: doctrine, audit, DELTA reconciliation, and high-level review.
   - Keep worker chats separate to avoid context contamination.

6. Google Drive
   - Artifact storage only: screenshots, PDFs, exported reports, large files.
   - Not the coordination ledger or source of task truth.

Required agent behavior:
Before work:
- Check the relevant task issue and, when available, the GAMMA-BUS Coordination Thread.
- Verify repo, branch, plane, scope, and task ownership.
- Assume parallel agents may be active.

During work:
- Stay within assigned scope.
- Do not apply fixes in one repo/agent context that could conflict with another agent’s sensitive pending work.
- If another agent/repo/human dependency is needed, create or update a GitHub issue rather than relying only on chat.

After work:
Report with:
- agent/model
- repo/branch
- plane
- files changed
- commands run
- tests/validation
- commit/PR/artifact/screenshot/receipt links
- unresolved risks
- next single action
- footer with agent label/model/role/plane/truth_mode/date

Truth and security constraints:
- No secrets in issues, memory files, prompts, or reports.
- No biological/scientific truth claims without Truth-plane receipts.
- Observation pages are not truth.
- GitHub Project state is task/control state, not scientific truth.
- Use `truth_mode: truth_safe_unverified` when no current receipt exists.
